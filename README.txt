To run the program compile all java files and run Main class. As a run parameter pass the path to the file containing graph.

The file should be in format:

nodes(n) edges(e) start(p) end(k) cost(z)
cost1 cost2 cost3 ... costn
u1 v1
u2 v2
.
.
.
ue ve

The program doesn't check the format of the input file. If the file is incorrect the program won't work.

Test files are in the folder test_files.
